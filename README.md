## Form App

In this App, I created two types of forms.

## Multi Stepform

This form has everything you need to be connected to a database.
After entering all the data, a json object is formed, which can then be used.

## Notes Form

You can add notes and delete it. Of course these notes will be synchronized with the server.
For this, I used Firebase Database and I hosted this app to their servers.

## Reflection

I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate, then adding react-router-4.3 and redux. Also, I used react-form library to create functional forms
and added it in local state. React-form was used also for validation of the login form. For design, I used Bootstrap library and I created some animations for fluidity.
Also in project you can find axios library, for work with firebase and react-router-dom for links
